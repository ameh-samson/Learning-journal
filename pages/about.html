                  After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer
                  Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to
                  get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet
                  like-minded peers.

              <span class="article-body-first-paragraph article-preview">
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend
                hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects
                using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
                projects.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span class="article-preview">
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share
                what I was learning and most things about my journey with the
                world.
                <br />

              <span class="article-body-title article-body-title-two"
                >How I got started</span

              <br />
              <span class="article-body-first-paragraph article-preview">
                I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I
                would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
                session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
                but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own
                words.
              </span>
              <br />
              <span class="article-preview">
                That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that
                posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and
                stay motivated.
